### Configuring HAMRS

Now that FLRIG is running and connected to your radio, we need to make sure HAMRS nows how to talk to it.

1. Open the **Config** menu

2. Go to the **Rig Control** tab

3. Enter the hostname/ip address and XMLRPC port in HAMRs config - the default may be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
4. Click the **'Test Connection'** button.

### Common Troubleshooting
**Issue: Cannot Connect to FLRIG**

- Check if FLRIG is Running
- Ensure the FLRIG application is open and connected to your radio.
- Verify Host and Port
- Confirm that the host is localhost (or the correct IP address) and the port is 12345 (or your FLRIG configuration).
